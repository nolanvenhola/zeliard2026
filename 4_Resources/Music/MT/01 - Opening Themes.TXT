                          UPDATED MT-32 VERSION

 System Requirements:

  - MIDI playback software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
      MIDI File format and embedded SysEx data
  - Roland MT-32, MT-100, CM-32L, CM-64, or LAPC-1
  - MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface
      (Not required for LAPC-1 users.)



This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Sierra's "Zeliard"
arcade game.  It contains embedded System Exclusive patch data which will
write new sounds to your MT-32.  Note that MIDI files which contain embedded
SysEx data are not compatible with all MIDI file playback software.

Converted to Standard MIDI File format by Tom Lewandowski.  Address
