# Game Systems & Mechanics

Complete technical specifications for all internal game systems.

---

## Leveling & Experience System

### Level Progression (0-255)
- **Starting Level**: 0 (80 HP)
- **Maximum Level**: 255 (800 HP at level 15, caps at 800)
- **Level Up Method**: Visit Sage after gaining required experience

### Health Points by Level

| Level | Health Points | Level | Health Points |
|-------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 80           | 8     | 540          |
| 1     | 120          | 9     | 600          |
| 2     | 160          | 10    | 640          |
| 3     | 240          | 11    | 680          |
| 4     | 280          | 12    | 720          |
| 5     | 320          | 13    | 760          |
| 6     | 380          | 14    | 780          |
| 7     | 460          | 15    | 800 (max)    |

**Note**: Health increases are irregular, not linear!

### Experience Requirements

Experience required PER LEVEL (not cumulative):

| Level | Experience | Level | Experience |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1     | 50        | 9     | 6,000     |
| 2     | 150       | 10    | 8,000     |
| 3     | 300       | 11    | 10,000    |
| 4     | 420       | 12    | 15,000    |
| 5     | 1,000     | 13    | 20,000    |
| 6     | 1,500     | 14    | 40,000    |
| 7     | 3,000     | 15    | 50,000    |
| 8     | 5,000     | 16+   | 60,000    |

**Total XP to reach Level 16**: 220,420

**Important Experience Mechanics**:
1. When you level up, XP cost is subtracted from current XP
2. **XP Overflow Cap**: Game prevents holding enough XP to level twice
   - Example: At level 0 with 400 XP, need 50 to level up
   - After leveling, you'd expect 350 XP remaining
   - Game caps it at 149 XP (1 less than next level requirement of 150)
   - **This prevents double-leveling and wastes excess XP!**

3. **Maximum XP**: 65,535 (can't hold more, excess is wasted)

### Sage Progress Messages
Based on current XP vs. required XP:

- **< 50%**: "You must persevere"
- **50-74%**: "You must accumulate more experience"
- **75-99%**: "I see the faint light of the spirits"
- **100%+**: Ready to level up

### Fast Leveling Strategy
In early levels (Muralla/Satono/Bosque):
- **Dying gives experience**
- Kill yourself once, level up, kill yourself twice, level up...
- Use F9 Speed 9 to speed up the process
- Effective until life meter is half full

---

## Damage System

### Sword Damage Formula

**Base Damage** = `Sword_Base + floor(Level / 2)`

Sword base damage values:

| Sword | Base Damage | With Sabre Oil (~230%) |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| Training Sword | 1 | ~2.3 |
| Wise Man's Sword | 2 | ~4.6 |
| Spirit Sword | 4 | ~9.2 |
| Knight's Sword | 8 | ~18.4 |
| Illumination Sword | 16 | ~36.8 |
| Enchantment Sword | 255 | ~586.5 |

**Level Damage Bonus**:
- Applies every 2 levels (rounds down if odd)
- Level 0: +0
- Level 1: +0 (rounds down from 0.5)
- Level 2: +1
- Level 3: +1 (rounds down from 1.5)
- Level 4: +2
- Level 255: +127

**Example Calculations**:
- Level 4 Training Sword: 1 + 2 = 3 damage
- Level 4 Wise Man's Sword: 2 + 2 = 4 damage
  (Same as Level 2 Spirit Sword!)
- Level 255 Training Sword: 1 + 127 = 128 damage
  (Half the damage of Level 0 Enchantment Sword!)

**Sabre Oil Effect**:
- Increases sword damage by approximately **230%**
- Effect is cumulative (stacks)
- Essential for late-game bosses

### Shield Mechanics

**Shield Power Values**:

| Shield | Power | Effective Durability |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Clay Shield | 30 | Very low |
| Wise Man's Shield | 80 | Low |
| Stone Shield | 180 | Medium |
| Honor Shield | 300 | Medium-High |
| **Light Shield** | 300 | **High** (special) |
| Titanium Shield | 600 | Very High |

**Special Case: Light Shield**
- Same power rating (300) as Honor Shield
- **Much more durable in practice**
- Made of magic metal "Magane"
- Loses strength at a MUCH slower rate
- Essential upgrade for Gold Caverns despite same stat value

**Shield Repair**:
- Visit Weapons Master in town for free repairs
- Holy Water of Acero restores shield (mostly useless)

---

## Magic System

### Spell Progression
Spells are granted by the Sage as you level up:

1. **Espada** - Throws swords (weak, short range)
2. **Saeta** - Throws arrows (good range, useful for breaking walls)
3. **Fuego** - Fire that burns on ground (short range, kills green slime)
4. **Lanzar** - Flame projectile (great range and damage)
5. **Rascar** - Rocks fall from ceiling (hard to aim, mostly useless)
6. **Agua** - Water projectile (powerful, kills most enemies in 1 hit)
7. **Guerra** - Lightning in all directions (ultimate spell, massive damage)

### Magic Items & Effects

**Elixir of Kashi**: Restores **1 spell** use (cheap, limited)

**Chikara Powder**: Restores **ALL spell** uses (expensive, essential)

**Magia Stone**: Best magic item
- Creates protective forcefield around player
- Damages all enemies that come near
- Lasts until: entering town OR extensive use
- Can defeat early bosses in seconds
- Strategy: Stand next to boss, let stone do the work
- **Pro tip**: Step away from boss as it dies to save duration

---

## Combat Mechanics

### Directional Attacks
1. **Horizontal Swing**: [Spacebar] while standing
2. **Upward Swing**: [Up Arrow] + [Spacebar] - hits airborne enemies
3. **Downward Thrust**: [Up] + [Down] + [Spacebar] - difficult, requires practice

### Alternative Attack Strategy
For enemies requiring head hits:
- Crouch and face AWAY from enemy
- Swing sword - back end of sword swings high enough to hit head
- Safer but more difficult than jumping

### Damage Types
- **Contact Damage**: Bumping into enemies (damages shield/health)
- **Projectile Damage**: Enemy ranged attacks (values vary)
- **Environmental Damage**: Fire, Gelroid, thorns (requires special shoes)

### Invulnerability Trick (Blue Potion Exploit)
**Setup**:
1. Get health low (let enemies hit you)
2. Open chest near boss room
3. Drink Blue Potion
4. **Immediately** enter boss room (don't wait for full heal)

**Effect**:
- Temporarily immortal during potion healing
- Health can drop to zero without dying
- Continuously regenerates during effect
- Allows aggressive close-range combat
- Must defeat boss before potion effect ends

**Works on**: Vista, Dragon, Alguien (all have hidden Blue Potions outside)

---

## Currency System

### Almas & Gold
**Almas Types**:
- Almas I: 1 alma (common drops)
- Almas X: 10 almas (deeper caverns)
- Almas C: 100 almas (tough enemies)

**Exchange Rates** (Almas to Gold):

| Satono | 1:6 |
| Bosque | 1:8 |
| Helada | 1:4 |
| Tumba | 1:2 |
| Dorado | 1:4 |
| Llama | 4:2 (worst rate!) |
| Pureza | 1:6 |
| Esco | 1:8 (best rate) |

### Banking System
- **Deposit/Withdraw**: Any amount in increments of 1 (left/right) or 10 (up/down)
- **Banker Mood**: Happy when depositing 1000+ gold, annoyed if no transaction
- Money is safe even after death

---

## Death & Resurrection

**Death Mechanics**:
- Always respawn at Muralla Sage's hut
- **Death gives experience points** (useful in early game)
- Keep all items, gold, and progress
- Lose current cavern position

---

- **0**: Slowest
- **9**: Fastest (recommended for farming/grinding)

Useful for:

- Boss practice at slow speed
- Grinding through easy areas

## Boss #8: Dragon (The 4Ds: Death, Doom, Decay, Destruction)

**Location**: The Burning Inferno (Level 7)

**Rewards**:
- 2,500 almas + crystal
- 12,000 Experience Points
- Life bar: ~Very Long

**Attack Pattern** (3-way breath attack):
1. **Far distance**: Horizontal flame
2. **Medium distance**: Burns ground at distance from Dragon
3. **Close distance**: Burns ground right next to Dragon

**Special**: Cannot fly despite having wings

**WARNING**: **MOST DIFFICULT BOSS** - harder than Alguien or even Jashiin!

**Attack Strategy** (Nearly Impossible):
- **NEVER JUMP** (instant death - Dragon's neck comes down, kills in 3 counts)
- Stand at medium distance
- Wait for Dragon to start fire breath
- When Dragon fires at ground away from him:
  - Run toward Dragon
  - Stand next to body
  - Slash while Dragon is busy burning other side
- When Dragon stops breathing fire:
  - Move back to medium distance
  - Repeat pattern
- **If Dragon fires directly at you: DO NOT JUMP** (tank the damage rather than jump-death)
- Use Sabre Oil (multiple applications)
- Reduce game speed with F9 for better control
- Agua/Rascar/Lanzar spells: ineffective (Agua evaporates)
- Practice many times before success

**Recommended Equipment**:
- Illumination Sword + multiple Sabre Oils (REQUIRED)
- Titanium Shield
- Multiple Juu-en Fruits
- Patience

**The Easy Way** (Blue Potion Exploit):
1. **DO NOT enter Encounter Zone yet**
2. Use Magia Stone outside boss room
3. Apply ALL Sabre Oils you have
4. Find Parrot Man below Encounter Zone
5. **Intentionally get hurt** by Parrot Man until low health
6. Kill Parrot Man
7. Return up, open chest near door
8. Drink Blue Potion
9. **IMMEDIATELY enter Encounter Zone** (don't wait for full heal)
10. **You are now temporarily immortal!**
   - Potion healing effect keeps you alive
   - Health can drop to zero without dying
   - Regenerates continuously
11. Run to Dragon, slash continuously
12. **Jump and slash** (head/neck take more damage - jumping is safe now!)
13. Bump into Dragon all you want (won't hurt health, just shield)
14. Dragon's fire doesn't kill you
15. Must finish Dragon before potion effect ends
16. After victory, small health remains
17. Blue Potion near next cavern entrance for full heal

**Video**: Check "Fun with Bugs" section for video demonstration

**Alternative Way** (bskinz method):
**Requirements**: Magia Stone, lots of Jujuen Fruit, Illumination Sword

1. Activate Magia Stone
2. Stand back for first flame blast
3. When Dragon is far and leans down to warm up breath:
   - This is the ONLY interruptible animation
   - Jump and chop head as Dragon leans down
   - Dragon steps back and blinks (your cue)
4. Get away immediately:
   - Dragon may breathe fire down (painful)
   - OR do lightning-fast CHOMP (1/6 health bar with shield, 1/3 without!)
5. Repeat jump-chop when Dragon leans for long-range breath
6. **Part Two**: If Dragon closes distance:
   - Shoot with Lanzar or Agua as Dragon approaches
   - MUST shoot BEFORE Dragon starts downward flame
   - Otherwise get roasted anyway
7. Don't let health drop below 1/3 bar (single chomp to back = death)
8. Requires lots of patience

**Difficulty**: EXTREME (hardest boss in game)

**Note**: This technique also works on Vista and Alguien (both have hidden Blue Potions outside Encounter Zone - slash dead-end walls)

---

## Boss #9: Alguien (Giant Bat Creature)

**Location**: The Fruit Gardens (Level 8)

**Rewards**:
- 3,800 almas + 2 crystals
- 30,000 Experience Points (MASSIVE!)
- Life bar: ~Very Long

**Attack Pattern**:
- Uses **non-avoidable breath attack** (tongue?)
- Flies left and right
- Tries to kick player
- Not very effective at attacking

**Lore**: Jashiin gave Alguien "eternal life" (meaning: respawns if you die or teleport out)

**Attack Strategy**:
- Wear Feruza Shoes (required for high jumps)
- Jump around, slash at **tail**
- Jump through breath attack
- Boss is relatively easy despite intimidating size

**Recommended Equipment**:
- Illumination Sword or Enchantment Sword
- Titanium Shield
- Feruza Shoes (REQUIRED)

**The Easy Way**:
- **Magia Stone useless** (Alguien too high)
- **About 3 Guerra spells** finish him (massive damage)
- Alternative: Bring Chakira Powder to restore magic
- Conserve Guerra for Jashiin if possible

**Difficulty**: Medium-Easy (easier than expected after Dragon)

**Farming Strategy**:
- Alguien gives 30,000 XP
- Levels 16+ require 60,000 XP each
- Kill Alguien twice per level
- Use Kioku Feather to teleport back after each kill
- Efficient leveling method!

## Boss #10: Jashiin (Final Boss)

**Location**: Jashiin's Chamber (After defeating Alguien)

**Rewards**:
- 9th Tear of Esmesanti (beat game)
- 10,000 Experience Points
- Life bar: ~Very Long (similar to Dragon)

**Phase 1 - Invisible Phase**:
**Attack Pattern**:
- Jashiin is **invisible** (can phase out)
- Appears temporarily
- Fires Fuego or Lightning Bolt
- Disappears again

**Strategy**:
- When Jashiin appears:
  - Avoid Fuego/Lightning by jumping away
  - Attack with sword while visible
  - Alternative: Use Guerra spell to weaken
- **Jashiin only gets hurt when visible**
- **No damage during invisible or blinking states**

**Phase 2 - Visible Phase** (After Weakening):
**Attack Pattern**:
- Loses ability to phase out
- Runs backward left or right
- Jumps over player when cornered
- Can **rapidly heal** (~25 HP at once!)
- Regains phase-out ability if fully healed

**Strategy**:
- Run up and slash with sword
- Slash when Jashiin jumps overhead (jump with him)
- **Agua spell**: Ineffective (not much damage)
- **Chakira Powder**: Use if available
- Keep Feruza Shoes equipped (jump with Jashiin)
- Jashiin walks faster than player - mostly hit during jumps

**Recommended Equipment**:
- Enchantment Sword or Illumination Sword
- Multiple Sabre Oils (essential)
- Titanium Shield
- Chakira Powder
- Juu-en Fruit (backup healing)
- Feruza Shoes

**The Easy Way** (Corner Trick):
1. When Jashiin doesn't appear initially:
   - Move to a corner
   - Wait for Jashiin
2. When Jashiin appears in corner:
   - Fire Guerra spell
   - Jump straight up (avoid fire)
   - **DON'T move away from corner**
3. If near corner, Jashiin won't disappear!
   - Just blinks for a moment
   - Reappears quickly (no 1-2 second wait)
   - Fastens the process considerably
4. After weakening, chase with Enchantment Sword
5. Use Sabre Oil (very useful)
6. **Magia Stone not recommended** (save for other uses)
7. **Juu-en Fruit**: Keep for emergency healing
   - If Jashiin heals before you kill him, you need HP too

**Difficulty**: Medium-Easy (surprisingly easier than Dragon)

**Fun Factor**: Actually enjoyable boss fight!

---

2. **Pulpo** - Passive until attacked, very easy
