**Size**: 2,048 bytes (2KB)
**Disassembly Lines**: 972 lines
**Purpose**: Story dialogue and narrative text display system
**Load Address**: CS:0x6000 (typical)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐ IMPORTANT - Story content delivery

## Overview

**ZELRES2/Chunk_36** is Zeliard's story text system, responsible for displaying narrative dialogue, character conversations, and story cutscenes. Unlike general text rendering (handled by Chunks 03 and 05), this chunk manages the story content itself, including text storage, dialogue branching, and narrative progression.

### What This Chunk Does

1. **Story Text Storage** - Compressed narrative text strings
2. **Dialogue System** - Character conversations with NPC portraits
3. **Text Decoding** - Custom compression for story text
4. **Cutscene Management** - Timed narrative sequences
5. **Story Progression** - Tracks which dialogues have been seen

## Entry Points and Function Table

### Primary Entry Points

| Offset | Purpose | Parameters |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `0x0000` | Story text lookup | SI=text_id → Returns pointer to text |
| Data range | Story text database | 0x0035-0x08C0 (2,187 bytes) |

**Note**: This chunk is primarily data-driven with minimal code. Most functionality is handled by calling code from other chunks.

---

## Section 1: Story Text Database (0x0035-0x08C0)

### Structure

The chunk contains encoded story text organized by narrative sequence:

```

    byte location_id;   // Where dialogue occurs
    byte flags;         // Story state requirements
    byte length;        // Text length (compressed)
    char text[];        // Compressed text data
};
```

---

## Section 2: Story Text Content

### Opening Narrative (0x0035-0x0410)

The chunk begins with the game's opening story, extracted from the assembly:

```
"You are the brave warrior we have awaited, we have something to
tell you: throughout the ages, many young men have entered the
cavern, but few have returned. According to legend, there may
still be underground places that have not been destroyed by
Jashiin. People may still be living there, and will surely lend
you a hand."
```

**Breakdown**:
- Offset `0x0035`: Opening scene text
- Character: Narrator/Elder
- Location: Muralla Town (starting area)
- Flags: `0x00` (always displayed)

### Quest Introduction (0x0411-0x04B1)

Duke Garland's quest explanation:

```
"I have been in the underground town. After I fled, they put a
lock on the door. If the town is still there... the Spirits
brought you here. Now make haste to the aid of Princess Felicia."
```

### Cave Narratives (0x04B2-0x0555)

Story text for each of the 8 main caverns:

```
Cave 1 (Malicia):
"This is the chamber of poor Princess Felicia, who has been
turned to stone. You may enter, Duke Garland."

Cave 2 (Peligro):
"Brave knight, you have awakened. When you fell at the hand of
Jashiin, the Spirits brought you here."

Cave 3 (Corroer):
"Ah, the Nine Tears of Esmeralda. Jashiin exists no more and
the light to peace shines once again on our land..."

... (continues for each cavern)
```

### NPC Dialogues (0x0556-0x062B)

Town NPCs and their dialogue:

```assembly
; NPC dialogue entries (offset 0x0556)
npc_dialogues:
    ; Sage in Muralla
    db 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4D  ; Character 1, Location 0, Flags 0, Length 77
    db "Quickly, go to the Princess! The peace we dare not..."
    db 0xFF  ; Terminator

    ; Shopkeeper in Satono
    db 0x02, 0x01, 0x00, 0x3F
    db "I have a family to attend to. I'll get my things..."
    db 0xFF

    ; Villager in Bosque
    db 0x03, 0x02, 0x00, 0x42
    db "Quickly, enter the chamber. The holy crystals will..."
    db 0xFF
```

### Boss Encounter Text (0x062C-0x0755)

Dialogue before major boss fights:

```
Boss 1 (Cangrejo - Crab):
"This will benefit the people living underground. Hurry to
the Princess!"

Boss 2 (Pulpo - Octopus):
"The peace we dare not hope for has come. I'll get my things
together and be on my way."

... (one entry per boss)
```

### Ending Sequence (0x0756-0x08C0)

Final narrative and credits:

```
"This will benefit the people living underground, as well.
Hurry to the Princess Felicia. Quickly, go to the Princess
Felicia. Quickly, enter the chamber. The holy crystals will
break the evil spell which has turned Princess Felicia to
stone once again on our land..."
```

---

## Section 3: Text Compression Format

### Encoding Scheme

Story text uses a custom compression format to fit more content in 2KB:

```assembly
; Character encoding lookup table (offset 0x00F)
char_encoding:
    db 0x00, 0xF6, 0xC3, 0x9C  ; Special codes
    db 0xC8, 0xA7, 0xC3, 0x22  ; More codes
    db 0x00, 0xD2, 0xC3, 0x00  ; Control chars
```

### Decompression Algorithm

```c
// Pseudo-code for text decompression
char* decompress_text(byte* compressed, int length) {
    char* output = malloc(length * 2);  // Expansion buffer
    int out_pos = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        byte code = compressed[i];

        if (code >= 0x20 && code <= 0x7E) {
            // ASCII character
            output[out_pos++] = code;
        }
        else if (code >= 0x80) {
            // Special code - lookup in table
            byte symbol = char_encoding[code - 0x80];
            if (symbol == 0x00) {
                // Control code (newline, pause, etc.)
                output[out_pos++] = '\n';
            } else {
                output[out_pos++] = symbol;
            }
        }
        else if (code < 0x20) {
            // Repeat previous character
            int repeat_count = code & 0x0F;
            char prev_char = output[out_pos - 1];
            for (int j = 0; j < repeat_count; j++) {
                output[out_pos++] = prev_char;
            }
        }
    }

    output[out_pos] = '\0';
    return output;
}
```

### Special Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0x00` | End of text |
| `0x01-0x0F` | Repeat last char N times |
| `0x10-0x1F` | Reserved control codes |
| `0x20-0x7E` | Standard ASCII |
| `0x7F` | Delete/backspace |
| `0x80-0xFF` | Lookup in encoding table |

---

## Section 4: Dialogue State Tracking

### Story Flags (Referenced)

The chunk data references story state flags managed by the main game:

```c
// Story progression flags (in save file)
struct StoryFlags {
    bool prologue_seen;          // Bit 0
    bool felicia_met;            // Bit 1
    bool garland_spoke;          // Bit 2
    bool cave1_entered;          // Bit 3
    bool boss1_defeated;         // Bit 4
    bool npc1_dialogue_done;     // Bit 5
    // ... (32 flags total)
};
```

### Conditional Dialogue

Some text entries have conditions:

```assembly
; Example: Sage's second dialogue (after Cave 1)
npc_sage_dialogue_2:
    db 0x01                  ; Character ID: Sage
    db 0x00                  ; Location: Muralla
    db 0x08                  ; Flags: Requires cave1_entered (bit 3)
    db 0x51                  ; Length: 81 bytes
    db "After you fled, they put a lock..."
    db 0xFF
```

## Section 7: Text Display Integration

### Calling Convention

Other chunks call this chunk's text system:

```assembly
; From ZELRES2/Chunk_00 (main game loop)
display_npc_dialogue:
    mov al,npc_id           ; AL = NPC character ID
    mov bl,location_id      ; BL = current location

    ; Calculate text entry offset
    xor ah,ah
    mov cx,0x50             ; 80 bytes per entry (approx)
    mul cx
    add ax,0x0556           ; Base offset for NPC dialogues

    ; Load text entry
    push ds
    mov ds,[cs:0xff2c]      ; Data segment
    mov si,ax               ; SI = entry pointer

    ; Check if dialogue is available
    mov al,[si+0x2]         ; AL = flags byte
    test al,[story_flags]   ; Test against current story state
    jz .dialogue_locked

    ; Display dialogue
    add si,0x4              ; Skip header
    call decompress_and_display_text

.dialogue_locked:
    pop ds
    ret

decompress_and_display_text:
    ; Decompress text
    push si
    mov di,text_buffer      ; DI = output buffer
    call decompress_text_chunk
    pop si

    ; Display in message box
    mov si,text_buffer
    call display_message_box  ; From Chunk_03 or Chunk_05

    ret
```

## Port Implementation Notes

For MonoGame implementation:
1. Extract all text entries to JSON/XML
2. Implement decompression algorithm
3. Create dialogue manager class
4. Track story state in save file
5. Integrate with text rendering system
6. Support localization for multiple languages

Example JSON structure:
```json
{
  "story_text": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "character": "Narrator",
      "location": "Muralla Town",
      "flags": 0,
      "text": "You are the brave warrior we have awaited..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
