## TGA vs CGA vs EGA

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | CGA | **TGA** | EGA |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Resolution | 320×200 | 320×200 / 640×200 | 640×350 |
| Colors | 4 from 16 | **16 from 16** | 16 from 64 |
| Palette | Fixed | **Programmable** | Programmable |
| Memory | 16KB | **128KB** | 256KB |
| Architecture | Interleaved | **Planar (4-plane)** | Planar (4-plane) |
| Sound | PC speaker | **3-voice + noise** | PC speaker |
| Price (1985) | $400 | **Included with PC** | $800 |

**Key Advantage**: TGA provided EGA-like graphics (16 colors, planar) at CGA-like pricing (came with computer).

## TGA Memory Architecture

### 4-Bitplane System (Similar to EGA)

```
Each pixel = 4 bits (one from each plane)
Plane 0 (Color bit 0): [b b b b b b b b] ← 8 pixels
Plane 1 (Color bit 1): [b b b b b b b b]
Plane 2 (Color bit 2): [b b b b b b b b]
Plane 3 (Color bit 3): [b b b b b b b b]

Pixel color = (p3 << 3) | (p2 << 2) | (p1 << 1) | p0

Same as EGA! Result: 16 colors (0-15)
```

**Key Difference from CGA**:
- CGA: 2 bits per pixel, interleaved scanlines
- TGA: 4 bits per pixel, planar architecture
- Easier to program than CGA (no interleaving!)

**Key Difference from EGA**:
- TGA: Fixed 16-color palette (cannot change palette entries)
- EGA: 16 colors chosen from 64-color palette
- TGA: Simpler (no palette programming)

---

## TGA Register Programming

### Graphics Mode Control (0x3D8)

```assembly
mov dx,0x3d8        ; Mode control register
mov al,0x1A         ; TGA 320×200 16-color mode
out dx,al

; Bits:
; 0x1A = 00011010
; Bit 4: 1 = Graphics enable
; Bit 3: 1 = 16-color mode
; Bit 1: 1 = 320×200 (vs 640×200)
```

### Palette Register (0x3D9)

```assembly
mov dx,0x3d9        ; Palette register
mov al,border_color ; Color for border/overscan
out dx,al
```

**Note**: Unlike EGA/VGA, TGA has **no palette RAM**. The 16 colors are fixed:

**TGA Fixed 16-Color Palette**:
| Index | Color | RGB Approx |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Black | #000000 |
| 1 | Blue | #0000AA |
| 2 | Green | #00AA00 |
| 3 | Cyan | #00AAAA |
| 4 | Red | #AA0000 |
| 5 | Magenta | #AA00AA |
| 6 | Brown | #AA5500 |
| 7 | Light Gray | #AAAAAA |
| 8 | Dark Gray | #555555 |
| 9 | Light Blue | #5555FF |
| 10 | Light Green | #55FF55 |
| 11 | Light Cyan | #55FFFF |
| 12 | Light Red | #FF5555 |
| 13 | Light Magenta | #FF55FF |
| 14 | Yellow | #FFFF55 |
| 15 | White | #FFFFFF |

**Limitation**: Cannot change palette. All Tandy software uses same 16 colors.

---

## Planar Memory Access

### Writing Pixels (4-Plane Write)

TGA uses the same planar technique as EGA:

```assembly
; Setup for 4-plane write:
mov dx,0x3ce        ; Graphics controller (EGA-compatible)
mov ax,0x0005       ; Write Mode 0
out dx,ax

mov dx,0x3c4        ; Sequencer
mov ax,0x0F02       ; Map Mask = all planes (1111b)
out dx,ax

; Write pixel (affects all 4 planes):
mov byte [es:di],color_value
; Hardware distributes bits across 4 planes
```

**Example**: Writing color 13 (Light Magenta = 1101 binary):
- Hardware sets bit in Plane 3 (high bit = 1)
- Hardware sets bit in Plane 2 (bit 2 = 1)
- Hardware clears bit in Plane 1 (bit 1 = 0)
- Hardware sets bit in Plane 0 (bit 0 = 1)

All from one `mov [es:di],13` instruction!

## Code Similarities to gmega.bin

### Shared Architecture

Since TGA uses 4-bitplane architecture like EGA, **gmtga.bin** shares significant code with **gmega.bin**:

**Common Functions**:
- Planar memory access routines (80% similar)
- Map Mask register programming (identical)
- Sprite rendering (same 4-plane format)
- Text rendering (same font format)

**Differences**:
- TGA: No palette programming (fixed 16 colors)
- TGA: Simpler initialization (fewer registers)
- TGA: 320×200 only (no high-resolution mode)
- TGA: Memory at B800:0000 (vs EGA's A000:0000)

**Code Reuse Estimate**: ~70% of gmtga.bin is identical or nearly identical to gmega.bin.

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Comparison

**TGA vs CGA** (both 320×200):
```
TGA: Planar, no interleaving
CGA: Interleaved scanlines, 2-bit pixels

Pixel write speed:
  TGA: ~25 CPU cycles (planar overhead)
  CGA: ~55 CPU cycles (interleave + packing)

Result: TGA is 2× faster than CGA
```

**TGA vs EGA**:
```
TGA: 320×200, 4-plane (same architecture as EGA)
EGA: 640×350, 4-plane

Pixel write complexity: Same
Resolution difference: EGA has 3.5× more pixels

Result: TGA renders faster due to lower resolution
```

**TGA vs VGA Mode 13h**:
```
TGA: Planar (4 writes per pixel)
VGA: Linear (1 write per pixel)

Result: VGA is ~4× faster
```

## TGA Sound Advantage

### Texas Instruments SN76496 (3-Voice PSG)

Tandy's killer feature was **built-in sound**:

```
3 Square Wave Channels:
  Channel 0: Melody (adjustable frequency)
  Channel 1: Harmony (adjustable frequency)
  Channel 2: Bass (adjustable frequency)

1 Noise Channel:
  White noise or periodic (drums/effects)

4-bit Volume Control per channel (0-15)
```

**Programming**:
```assembly
mov al,0x80 | (channel << 5) | frequency_low
out 0xc0,al             ; TGA sound port

mov al,frequency_high
out 0xc0,al
```

**Game Audio Stack** (with TGA):
```
mscjr.drv  → Programs SN76496 for music
sndjr.drv  → Programs SN76496 for sound effects
stdply.bin → Sequences musical notes
```

**Advantage**: 3-voice music vs PC speaker's 1-voice beeps!

## Memory Layout

### TGA Video Memory (128KB)

```
B800:0000 ─┬─ Plane 0 (bit 0)    32KB
           ├─ Plane 1 (bit 1)    32KB
           ├─ Plane 2 (bit 2)    32KB
           └─ Plane 3 (bit 3)    32KB
                                 ────
                          Total: 128KB

320×200 × 4 planes = 256,000 bits = 32,000 bytes per plane
```

**Address Calculation** (320×200 mode):
```c
offset = (y * 40) + (x / 8);  // 40 bytes per row
address = 0xB800:offset;
bit = 7 - (x % 8);            // Bit position (MSB first)
```

**Unused Memory**: Each plane is 32KB, but only uses 8KB (320×200/8 bits). Remaining 24KB per plane can store additional graphics for page flipping or sprite caching.

---

## Sprite Rendering

### TGA Sprite Format

Same as EGA: **4 separate bitplanes per sprite**

```c
struct TGA_Sprite {
    uint8_t plane0[width * height / 8];  // Bit 0 of color
    uint8_t plane1[width * height / 8];  // Bit 1 of color
    uint8_t plane2[width * height / 8];  // Bit 2 of color
    uint8_t plane3[width * height / 8];  // Bit 3 of color
};

// 16×16 sprite = 32 bytes per plane × 4 planes = 128 bytes total
```

**Rendering Process**:
```assembly
; For each plane (0-3):
    mov dx,0x3c4        ; Sequencer
    mov ah,0x01         ; Map Mask value (1, 2, 4, or 8)
    shl ah,plane_num    ; Shift to select plane
    mov al,0x02         ; Map Mask register
    out dx,ax           ; Enable only this plane

    ; Copy plane data to screen:
    mov si,sprite_data_plane[plane_num]
    mov di,screen_offset
    mov cx,height
.row_loop:
    movsb               ; Copy 16 pixels (2 bytes for 16-wide sprite)
    movsb
    add di,38           ; Next scanline (40 - 2)
    loop .row_loop

; Repeat for next plane
```

## Code Size: 3,704 Bytes

**Breakdown** (estimated):
- Function table: ~70 bytes
- Planar memory setup: ~400 bytes
- Sprite rendering: ~800 bytes
- Text rendering: ~600 bytes
- Rectangle/line drawing: ~500 bytes
- Screen operations: ~600 bytes
- Miscellaneous: ~734 bytes

**Why Similar to gmega.bin (3,736 bytes)?**
- Both use 4-plane architecture
- Both support 16 colors
- TGA slightly smaller (no palette programming code)

---

## Integration with Zeliard

### How game.bin Uses TGA Driver

```c
// Game engine calls (via function pointers):
tga_init(mode);                 // Initialize 320×200 16-color
tga_set_palette(border_color);  // Set border only (no palette RAM)
tga_draw_sprite(x, y, sprite);  // Render 4-plane sprite
tga_draw_rect(x, y, w, h, c);   // Fill rectangle
tga_render_text(x, y, text);    // Draw text with 4-plane font
tga_scroll_screen(dx, dy);      // Scroll playfield
```

**Sprite Data**:
- Stored in zelres archives in 4-plane format
- Same sprite data used for both TGA and EGA modes
- Only difference: EGA can use higher resolution

**Color Choices**:
- Artists limited to fixed 16-color palette
- Must design all artwork around these specific colors
- Cannot use subtle palette tricks (like VGA games)
