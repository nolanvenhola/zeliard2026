## CGA Color Limitations

### Two Fixed 4-Color Palettes

CGA offers only 2 palette choices (selected at mode init):

**Palette 0 (Magenta/Cyan)**:
| Index | Color | RGB Approx |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Black | #000000 |
| 1 | Magenta | #FF00FF |
| 2 | Cyan | #00FFFF |
| 3 | White | #FFFFFF |

**Palette 1 (Red/Green)**:
| Index | Color | RGB Approx |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Black | #000000 |
| 1 | Red | #FF0000 |
| 2 | Green | #00FF00 |
| 3 | Yellow | #FFFF00 |

Plus an optional **intensity bit** that brightens all colors except background.

**Limitation**: Unlike EGA (16 colors) or VGA (256 colors), CGA is extremely restrictive. Games must carefully design artwork to work with only 4 colors!

---

## CGA Interleaved Scanlines

The defining feature of CGA is its **interleaved memory layout**.

### Memory Organization

```
CGA divides 200 scanlines into 2 banks:

Bank 0 (B800:0000): Even scanlines (0, 2, 4, 6, ..., 198)
  Size: 8,000 bytes (80 bytes × 100 scanlines)

Bank 1 (B800:2000): Odd scanlines (1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 199)
  Size: 8,000 bytes (80 bytes × 100 scanlines)
```

**Address Calculation**:
```c
// To find pixel (x, y):
if (y % 2 == 0) {
    // Even scanline: Bank 0
    offset = (y / 2) * 80 + (x / 4);
    address = 0xB800:offset;
} else {
    // Odd scanline: Bank 1
    offset = (y / 2) * 80 + (x / 4);
    address = 0xB800:(0x2000 + offset);
}
```

**Why Interleaved?**
This design was a hardware optimization in 1981:
- CGA memory is slow (200ns DRAM)
- Display refresh reads memory every scanline
- Interleaving gives memory more time to recover between accesses
- Reduces "snow" artifacts on cheap monitors

**Programming Consequence**: Every graphics operation must handle the interleaving!

## Key Code: Interleaved Scanline Handling

### Rectangle Drawing (0x0081-0x0097)

```assembly
0x0081  mov byte [es:di],0xf0   ; Write to current scanline
0x0085  mov byte [es:bx+di],0xf ; Write to end of row

; Move to next scanline (interleaved):
0x0089  add di,0x2000           ; Jump to opposite bank (+8192 bytes)
0x008D  cmp di,0x4000           ; Did we overflow into Bank 1?
0x0091  jc 0x97                 ; No overflow, continue

; Overflow: Wrap to next even/odd pair:
0x0093  add di,0xc050           ; Adjust: -0x4000 + 0x50 = next row in Bank 0

0x0097  loop 0x81               ; Repeat for height
```

**Explanation**:
- Start at scanline 0 (Bank 0, offset 0x0000)
- Add 0x2000: jump to scanline 1 (Bank 1, offset 0x2000)
- Add 0x2000: jump to scanline 2, but this goes to 0x4000 (overflow!)
- Detect overflow with `cmp di,0x4000`
- If overflowed: subtract 0x4000 and add 0x50 (80 bytes) to advance to next pair

**Result**: Scanline sequence is 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → ...

Compare to VGA: `add di,320` (simple linear increment!)

## Pixel Format

CGA packs 4 pixels per byte (2 bits per pixel):

```
Byte value: 0b11100100

Pixel 0 (bits 7-6): 11 = color 3 (White)
Pixel 1 (bits 5-4): 10 = color 2 (Cyan/Green)
Pixel 2 (bits 3-2): 01 = color 1 (Magenta/Red)
Pixel 3 (bits 1-0): 00 = color 0 (Black)

Result: [White][Cyan][Magenta][Black]
```

**Writing a Pixel**:
```c
void set_pixel_cga(x, y, color) {
    // Calculate bank and offset
    bank = (y % 2) * 0x2000;
    offset = (y / 2) * 80 + (x / 4);
    address = 0xB800 + bank + offset;

    // Calculate bit position
    shift = 6 - ((x % 4) * 2);  // 6, 4, 2, or 0

    // Read-modify-write
    byte old = memory[address];
    byte mask = ~(0x03 << shift);  // Clear 2-bit field
    byte value = (color & 0x03) << shift;
    memory[address] = (old & mask) | value;
}
```

**4 operations per pixel** vs VGA's 1 operation!

## CGA "Snow" Artifact

CGA has a notorious display problem called **"snow"**: white flecks appearing during writes.

**Cause**:
- CGA shares memory bus between CPU and display circuitry
- No video RAM buffering (direct DRAM access)
- Writing during active display causes bus contention
- Manifests as random white dots on screen

**Solutions**:

### 1. Wait for Vertical Retrace
```assembly
wait_retrace:
    mov dx,0x3da        ; CGA status register
wait_loop:
    in al,dx            ; Read status
    test al,0x08        ; Test bit 3 (vertical retrace)
    jz wait_loop        ; Wait until retrace starts
    ; Now safe to write!
```

### 2. Wait for Horizontal Retrace (faster)
```assembly
wait_hretrace:
    mov dx,0x3da        ; CGA status register
wait_h:
    in al,dx
    test al,0x01        ; Test bit 0 (horizontal retrace)
    jnz wait_h          ; Wait for end of retrace
    ; Brief window to write without snow
```

### 3. Disable Display (flicker warning!)
```assembly
    mov dx,0x3d8        ; CGA mode control
    mov al,0x25         ; Disable video signal
    out dx,al
    ; Write to video memory (no snow!)
    mov al,0x29         ; Re-enable video
    out dx,al
```

**gmcga.bin** likely uses method #1 (vertical retrace) for clean display.

## Performance Impact

### Comparison: CGA vs VGA Pixel Write

**VGA Mode 13h**:
```assembly
mov byte [es:di],color  ; 1 instruction
inc di
; ~10 CPU cycles
```

**CGA**:
```assembly
; Calculate interleaved address (20 cycles)
; Read byte (10 cycles)
; Mask and shift (15 cycles)
; Write byte (10 cycles)
; ~55 CPU cycles per pixel
```

**Result**: CGA is approximately **5× slower** than VGA for pixel operations.

---

## Code Size: 3,565 Bytes

**Breakdown**:
- Function table: ~70 bytes
- Interleaved scanline logic: ~500 bytes
- Sprite rendering (2-bit format): ~800 bytes
- Text rendering (4-color fonts): ~600 bytes
- Rectangle/line drawing: ~400 bytes
- Scroll/copy functions: ~600 bytes
- Miscellaneous: ~600 bytes

**Why not smaller?**
- Interleaving adds complexity
- Read-modify-write operations for pixel packing
- Palette limitations require dithering logic for grayscale
- Compatibility code for different CGA clones

## Dithering for "More Colors"

With only 4 colors, CGA games use **dithering** to simulate additional shades:

**Checkerboard Pattern** (simulates gray):
```
□■□■□■□■  (Black + White alternating)
■□■□■□■□
□■□■□■□■
■□■□■□■□
Result: Appears medium gray from distance
```

**2×2 Dither Matrices**:
```
25% gray:     50% gray:     75% gray:
□□            □■            ■□
□■            ■□            ■■

All 3 colors: Magenta + Cyan + White = Checkerboard lavender
```

Zeliard likely uses dithering for:
- Shadows (black + magenta)
- Mid-tones (magenta + white)
- Water (cyan + black)

---

## CGA Composite Mode (Artifact Colors)

**Hidden Feature**: CGA composite output can produce **16 colors**!

When connected to a composite (TV) monitor instead of RGB:
- 320×200 mode produces NTSC color artifacts
- Horizontal pixel transitions create false colors
- Specific pixel patterns generate red, orange, blue, green, etc.

**Example Pattern**:
```
Pixels: 01010101 (alternating on/off)
RGB display: Cyan-Black-Cyan-Black dither
Composite display: Solid orange!
```

**How It Works**:
- CGA clock = 14.31818 MHz (NTSC color subcarrier)
- Pixels at this frequency create phase shifts
- NTSC decoder interprets shifts as hue changes
- Result: 16 colors from 4-color mode!

**Games Using This**: King's Quest, Ultima, many Sierra adventures

**Zeliard**: Unlikely to use artifact colors (designed for RGB), but may appear different on composite.

## Technical Limitations

**What CGA Cannot Do**:

❌ **No hardware scrolling** - Must redraw entire screen
❌ **No palette changes** - Stuck with 2 fixed palettes
❌ **No smooth gradients** - Only 4 discrete colors
❌ **No transparency** - All 4 color indices are opaque
❌ **Slow animation** - Interleaving and packing slow down blits
❌ **Display artifacts** - "Snow" during writes if not careful

**What Makes CGA Challenging**:

⚠️ **Artwork constraints** - All graphics must use only 4 colors
⚠️ **Dithering required** - Simulate shades with patterns
⚠️ **Slow pixel ops** - Read-modify-write for every pixel
⚠️ **Bank switching** - Every row requires offset recalculation

## Why Support CGA in 1990?

By 1990, VGA was becoming standard, but CGA support was still important:

1. **Installed base**: Millions of CGA systems still in use
2. **Cost**: VGA cards were expensive ($300-500)
3. **Compatibility**: CGA worked on all IBM PCs from 1981+
4. **Portability**: Laptops often had CGA-compatible LCDs
5. **Developing markets**: CGA clones cheap in Asia, South America

**Zeliard's approach**: Support all major standards (CGA, EGA, Hercules, Tandy, VGA) to maximize sales.

## Summary

**gmcga.bin** provides bare-minimum graphics support for CGA systems:

- ✅ **4-color rendering** from 2 fixed palettes
- ✅ **320×200 resolution** (standard for DOS games)
- ✅ **Universal compatibility** (works on any IBM PC from 1981+)
- ✅ **Interleaved scanline handling** (avoids snow artifacts)
- ❌ **Extremely limited colors** (only 4 simultaneous)
- ❌ **Slow rendering** (~5× slower than VGA)
- ❌ **Complex programming** (interleaving + 2-bit packing)

**Key Challenge**: Making Zeliard playable and visually acceptable with only 4 colors. This required:
- Careful palette selection (magenta/cyan for fantasy theme)
- Extensive dithering for shading
- Simplified sprite artwork
- Strategic use of black outlines to separate objects

**Historical Context**: By supporting CGA in 1990, Sierra demonstrated commitment to accessibility, ensuring Zeliard could run on older, cheaper systems worldwide.

**Technical Achievement**: The gmcga.bin driver successfully handles all of CGA's quirks (interleaving, snow, pixel packing) while maintaining compatibility with the same game engine that drives the VGA version. That's impressive systems engineering! 🎨
