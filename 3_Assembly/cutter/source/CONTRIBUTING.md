# Contributing to Cutter

There are different ways you can help contributing to Cutter:

## Opening an issue

Make a clear description of the bug/feature, use screenshots, send binaries, etc.
This will help us improve the software for you.
You can create an issue by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing to the code

Note that cutter is still under development and many parts of the code are to be improved.
The best way is to check the opened issues [here](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/issues) or discuss with rizinorg team.
Please follow our contribution guidelines: https://cutter.re/docs/contributing.html

## Contributing to the documentation

The documentation is something important for newcomers. As of today the documentation can be found [here](https://cutter.re/docs/) and it stands in the [docs](docs) folder.
The API Reference is automatically generated from the source code, so it is strongly advised to document your code.
Check issues marked as "Documentation" on our issues [list](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation).

## Translations

You can help Cutter by adding translations to the project! We use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cutter) platform to help us share translations. Feel free to contribute and add translations to the project. If you need to add a language, ask any rizinorg developer.

## Usage of AI tools

Following the widespread availability of large language models and generative AI, Rizin Organization has received a growing number of changes generated partially or entirely using such tools. Many of these are completely unusable in our codebase.
While AI tools can help to draft changes, they must not replace human understanding and proper code modifications.

If you use AI tools to help prepare a code change, you must:

- **Disclose** which AI tools were used and specify what they were used for.
- **Verify** that the code compiles, works and is not copyrighted by somebody else.
- **Avoid** fabricated code, placeholder text, or references to non-existent code.

Changes that appear to be unverified AI output will be closed without response.
Repeated low-quality submissions may result in a ban.

We align with similar policies adopted by other major open-source projects, which have described the flood of unverified AI-generated code changes as disruptive, counterproductive, and a drain on limited team resources.
